Serverless architectures embody a massive shift happening in cloud computing.

Simply put, serverless computing changes the way developers think about writing, scaling and maintaining cloud applications.

# What is Serverless?


# About the Name

  Coined Serverless by iron.io(?), Serverless doesn't mean there are no more servers, just ones that you no longer have to think about.

  Servers with less management
  Servers with less development costs
  Servers with less scaling costs
  Servers with less operational costs
  Servers with less headache
  Serverless

  Also known as 'Function as a Service' or FAAS

# What isn’t Serverless?


# Benefits of Serverless Architectures
- Reduced operational cost
  - reduced infrastructure cost and lower operational cost
- BaaS - reduced development cost
- FaaS - scaling costs
- Easier Operational Management
- ‘Greener’ computing?

# Serverless Challenges
- Vender lock in
- Security concerns
  - larger surface area for attack
- No state
- Server optimizations out of your hands
- Limited configuration options
- Infinite Loops of death
- Limited execution durations
- Cold start times
- Testing overhead
- Function management (versioning, rollbacks, deployment)
- Monitoring overhead
- Limited education / patterns in the new space
