# Become a serverless meetup organizer

Become a local organizer for an official Serverless Meetup in your area.

## What are Serverless Meetups?

Serverless Meetups are a place to connect with other serverless enthusiasts and devs using the Serverless Framework in cities around the world. Facilitated by local organizers with support from the makers of the Serverless Framework, these gatherings showcase devs sharing their experience and best practices for building serverless architectures.

## What does the local organizer do?

- Hold 2-3 Meetups each quarter. (8-12 per year)
- Find host venues for local Meetups. Locations that can accommodate at least 50-75 people are ideal.
- Find presenters to give talks or lead workshops at Meetups. Talks range from 10-minute lightning talks to 90-minute workshops.
- Find sponsors to provide food and drinks at your Meetups.
- Lead the flow of activities and talks at Meetups.

## Serverless Meetup format:

- Meetups happen 2-3 times each quarter.
