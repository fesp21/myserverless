# Join a Serverless Meetup

[Serverless Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/pro/serverless/) are a place to connect with other serverless enthusiasts and devs using the Serverless Framework in cities around the world. Facilitated by local organizers with support from the makers of the Serverless Framework, these gatherings showcase devs sharing their experience and best practices for building serverless architectures.

Serverless Meetups are for users of the Serverless Framework and anyone interested in learning about serverless architectures, in general. Meetups include time to socialize over food and drinks, plus talks from serverless pioneers showcasing their projects or seeking feedback.

Maintaining an inclusive, welcoming environment at our Meetups is something we take seriously. Harassment or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated and we expect all participants to adhere to our Anti-Discrimination-Harassment Policy at all Meetups and events.
