# About Serverless

We’re a fully-remote team of developers, spread all over the world, focused on building world-class developer tooling for the future of event-driven serverless infrastructure.

In June 2015 we began building the world’s first serverless application framework, enabling developers to build web, mobile and IoT applications exclusively on event-driven infrastructure like AWS Lambda.

Since then, we’ve been on the front page of Hacker News several times, collected over 9,000 Github stars and received funding from two of the top VC firms in the cloud infrastructure space (we’ll announce who soon).
