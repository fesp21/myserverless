# [About Serverless](http://serverless.com/company)

## Why you will love working with us

### Ambition

We have a huge goal: to empower developers to build the next great software products and companies by allowing them to focus more time on building product and less on operations, scaling and infrastructure management. If you enjoy disrupting large industries and working on big hairy problems, youâ€™ll love it here.

We place the same focus on productivity with our team members that we do with our customers. That means great tooling, light-weight processes, and the removal of distractions so that you have the freedom to get stuff done.

### Personal Happiness
